A simple staking App.

Any user can stake in the contract before a pre-defined deadline.
The staked funds should reach a pre-defined threshold before the deadline so that any user can click on "Execute" and the funds will transfered to a Vault contract.
If the deadline has been reached and the staked funds are below the threshold, any user can withrdaw their funds back to their wallet.
